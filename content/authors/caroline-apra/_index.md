A practicing brain and spine neurosurgeon in Paris, France, Caroline completed her PhD in intracranial tumors and genetics, and joined Polina Anikeevaâ€™s team as a post-doctorate associate in 2021. She wishes to contribute to the transfer of the technology from the lab bench to the hospital. She focuses on studying brain plasticity and brain tumors, and will enthusiastically give clinical insight to all projects aimed at reaching the patients. When she is not in the operating room or the lab, Caroline enjoys reading, singing, exploring, and sharing those moments with her family and friends.
