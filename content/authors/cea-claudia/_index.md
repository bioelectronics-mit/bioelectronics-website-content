Claudia Cea completed her B.S. in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Pisa. She pursued her M.Sc. in Bioengineering in San Diego, focusing her research on the development of novel origami-based neural probes for epidural and intradural recording, as well as, neurotransmitter detection. Afterwards, she enrolled in a Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering at Columbia University. Her Ph.D. focused on the development of fast and sensitive soft bioelectronics devices that interact with signals generated by the neural tissue. Most significantly, she developed fully-flexible, standalone neuroelectronic devices based on organic electrochemical transistors and consisting exclusively of soft, biocompatible components -including the power supply and data transmission unit- for high spatiotemporal resolution recordings. Claudia is eager to contribute their expertise to the Bioelectronics group and build novel soft bioelectronic devices for studying electrophysiology in the gut-brain axis. Outside research, Claudia enjoys skiing, playing beach volley, watching tennis and old movies, and exploring new restaurants with friends.
