Dekel was born in Israel and completed her BSc in Biomedical Engineering at the Technion. She completed her PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the Technion focusing on tissue engineering and stem cells. Her thesis focused on the mechanical interplay between cells and scaffold within engineered tissues, applying external forces for influencing cell functionality. Fascinated by the idea that external stimulation can trigger cell functionality in the nervous   system,   she   decided   to   join   the   Bioelectronics   group   as   a postdoctoral fellow in 2016 to apply modulation techniques for activation of electroactive   cells   in   peripheral   organs.   Dekel   is   using   magnetothermalstimulation for remote control on hormone release from adrenal gland. In addition, she is studying the gut-to-brain axis through modulation of the enteric nervous system. Dekel is also developing magnetic nanocomposites constructs for controlling neuronal growth. Outside the lab Dekel enjoys spending time with her family, cooking and doing pilates.
