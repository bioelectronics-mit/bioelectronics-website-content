Hannah completed undergraduate degrees in Physics and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at MIT, where she continues on for her Master of Engineering. Hannah's undergraduate research explored the neural effects of anesthesia and developed computational tools for electrophysiology. Her passion for neuroengineering led her to join the Bioelectronics group in the Fall of 2020. With the guidance of Florian and Dekel, Hannah works on building alternating magnetic fields to stimulate nerve growth. Outside of the lab, Hannah can be found assembling her latest woodworking project, learning a new form of dance, or singing karaoke.
