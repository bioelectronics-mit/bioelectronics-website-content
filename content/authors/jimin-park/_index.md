Jimin joined the Bioelectronics group in November 2017. He completed a B.S./M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. After completing B.S./M.S., Jimin was in the center for biomaterials at Korea Institute of Science and Technology as a research scientist for 3.5 years. His previous research was mainly focused on developing biomimetic material systems for energy and biomedical applications. Here at Bioelectronics group, Jimin is trying to discover electrochemical and magnetochemical approaches to modulate the neural circuits and animal behaviors. Outside the lab, he enjoys hiking and exploring new restaurants and bars.
