After completing her B.S. and M.S. in Materials Chemistry at Ecole Polytechnique, France, Juliette joined the Bioelectronics group in September of 2017. She is co-advised by Professor Yoel Fink and her research focuses on building structural elasticity in fibers and using stretchable fiber devices as spinal cord implants.
Outside of lab, Juliette enjoys climbing, skiing or hiking depending on the season and singing in a choir.
