Junsang completed his B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at Seoul National University in South Korea. He joined the Bioelectronics group in 2015 Fall. Junsang's research focuses on multiplexed magneto-thermal control which allows selective control of any applications relying on magnetic nanoparticles as heat trigger. 
When Junsang is off from work, he enjoy playing tennis, cooking and watching interesting animals in YouTube videos.
