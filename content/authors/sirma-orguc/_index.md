After receiving her B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Sirma joined MIT EECS Department as a PhD student in 2014. She is jointly advised in Energy-Efficient Circuits and Systems Lab, led by Prof. Anantha Chandrakasan and the Bioelectronics Lab under the supervision of Prof. Polina Anikeeva since 2017. Her research is at the intersection of electronics, algorithms and materials; focusing mostly on system level design for biomedical and neuroscience applications. Recently, she has been working on modular optoelectronic systems for wireless, programmable neuromodulation during free behavior as well as the design and characterization of strain-programmable artificial muscles for soft-robotic applications. Outside the lab, Sirma enjoys spending time with my friends, cooking, exercising and to play with her lovely cats, Ciki and Barbar!
