Dr. Rao received her PhD degree in Materials Physics and Chemistry at Beihang University in China in 2015. Her PhD research was focused on energy conversion devices, such as rhodopsin-based photoelectric systems, direct methanol fuel cells. In her short-term visit at Monash University in Australia, she investigated the ionic transfer in nanoparticles-assembled two-dimensional superlattice. In early 2016, she joined the Bioelectronics Group at MIT. In 2016-2018, she has been awarded the Simons Postdoctoral Fellowship with the co-supervision of Profs. Polina Anikeeva and Guoping Feng. She is the leader in chemomagnetic technique development. Dr. Rao received the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) in 2019. Now she is transitioning into her independent career with her curiosity in neurobiology. 

Dr. Rao is hiring PhD students and postdocs for her [Neurobiological Interfaces Group](http://www.syraolab.com/) in Biomedical Engineering Department at UMass Amherst. Please contact her directly. 

Although she enjoys spending her time playing with chemicals or cells in lab, Dr. Rao is picking up the habit of 5k running along the Charles River.
