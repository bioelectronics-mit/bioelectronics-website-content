Ye Ji Kim received her B.S. and M.S. degree from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Her previous research mainly focused on elucidating the contribution of microenvironment constrained by three-dimensional nanostructures to the enhanced performance of electrocatalysts. She joined the Bioelectronics group in November 2020, fascinated by the capability to discover and develop tools to engineer microenvironments in brain. She is currently trying to modulate neural circuits with magnetic nanodiscs.

Outside the lab, she enjoys a happiness routine: exploring popular restaurants, having tea time with beautiful desserts, and exercising to burn all of the calories.
