Youngbin joined the Bioelectronics group in January 2017 after completing a B.S./M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at Hanyang University. His previous research was mainly focused on analyzing the properties of two-dimensional materials using DFT simulations. Here at Bioelectronics group, Youngbin is trying to develop advanced photopolymer for in-fiber photolithography and optoelectronics. When he is not in the lab, Youngbin usually enjoys playing sports (running, badminton, soccer) or spending time with his family.
