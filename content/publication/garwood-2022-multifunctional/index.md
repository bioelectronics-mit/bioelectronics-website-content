abstract: "Recording and modulating neural activity in vivo enables investigations of the neurophysiology underlying behavior and disease. However, there is a dearth of translational tools for simultaneous recording and localized receptor-specific modulation. We address this limitation by translating multifunctional fiber neurotechnology previously only available for rodent studies to enable cortical and subcortical neural recording and modulation in macaques. We record single-neuron and broader oscillatory activity during intracranial GABA infusions in the premotor cortex and putamen. By applying state-space models to characterize changes in electrophysiology, we uncover that neural activity evoked by a working memory task is reshaped by even a modest local inhibition. The recordings provide detailed insight into the electrophysiological effect of neurotransmitter receptor modulation in both cortical and subcortical structures in an awake macaque. Our results demonstrate a first-time application of multifunctional fibers for causal studies of neuronal activity in behaving nonhuman primates and pave the way for clinical translation of fiber-based neurotechnology."
